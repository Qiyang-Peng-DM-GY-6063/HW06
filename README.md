##### What dataset did you use? If not from our class site, include a link.
Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset?resource=download

##### Why did you choose this dataset?
Sleep is closely related to daily life, and I want to gain a more detailed understanding of the current sleep patterns of young people through this set of data visualizations.

##### Which fields/features/parameters of the dataset did you use?
I used the ID to determine the order and age as supplementary information for labeling. The data is categorized by gender to visualize sleep duration, sleep quality, and stress levels separately.

##### How many data points did you use?
374

##### What are you visualizing? How do the shapes, colors or movement relate to the data values?
I use the width of the rectangles to represent sleep quality, the height to represent sleep duration, the opacity to represent stress levels, and include labels for age.

##### Include drawings and images of reference visualizations
